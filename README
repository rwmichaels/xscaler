   XSCALER PACKAGE
   ================

The codes you mostly care about here are :

      THaScaler 
      THaScalerGui
      tscalgui_main

There are several other "main" routines for testing THaScaler,
but they are largely unecessary for hall C.

For general documentation about THaScaler, see

http://hallaweb.jlab.org/equipment/daq/THaScaler.html

See also notes in the Makefile.

Notes:

   1. Make sure you have the scaler map file in your directory.
      See 'scaler.map'.  This defines the buttons and tabs in
      the xscaler GUI.

   2. Start xscaler by typing "./xscaler".
      The default at the moment is for SHMS scalers.

   3. Parameters about the clock (what channel, what rate, etc)
      used to normalize the scalers are defined in the line 
      xscaler-clock SHMS slot:11 chan:1 rate:60
      in scaler.map.  They are checked versus assumptions in
      the code THaScaler::LoadDataRPC which loads from the server.
      I need to work on making that more robust, like I worry
      it will break if we add a 16-channel scaler, etc.
